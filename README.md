As you know recently, free or affordable access to bicycles has been provided for short-distance trips in an urban area as an alternative to motorized public transport or private vehicles. Thus, it is aimed to reduce traffic congestion, noise and air pollution.

In this project, the goal is to predict the number of future bike shares given the historical data of London bike shares. So this case should be handled as a time series problem with Bidirectional LSTM.
